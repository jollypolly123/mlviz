		I took 6.3900 (6.036) <strong>Introduction to Machine Learning</strong> at MIT in the Fall of 2022. This is a collection of tools I made for fun to help practice the concepts we learned in class. The topics we covered were (in order):
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Regression</li>
		<li>Gradient Descent</li>
		<li>Classifiers and Logistic Regression</li>
		<li>Features</li>
		<li>Clustering</li>
		<li>Neural Networks</li>
		<li>Convolutional Neural Networks</li>
		<li>State Machines and RNNs</li>
		<li><a href="/markov-decision-processes">Markov Decision Processes</a></li>
		<li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
		<li>Decision Trees and Nearest Neighbor</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		You can click the items in the list above to check out a tool I made for each topic. They provide visualizations and allow you to do calculations. I hope you find them useful!
